# Prerequisite: install blast+ from ncbi, download the nt database and create a gorilla database from the gorilla3 genome
MGRAST
	Navigate to http://metagenomics.anl.gov/?page=Home
	Log innd 
	Click on the barchart icon in upper right corner of screen to go to the anaylsis page
	For every metagenome of interest:
		Select a metagenome
		For every RNA Annotation Source (do not use M5RNA):
			Select a RNA annotation Source
			Change 'Max. e-Value Cutoff' to -20
			Change 'Min. % Identity Cutoff' to 50
			Change 'Min. Alignment Length Cutoff' to 10
			Select the radio button next 'barchart'
			Generate
			Navigate the barchart to 'Eukaryota'->'Chordata'->'Mammalia'->'Primates'->'Hominidae'
			Select 'to workbench' next to 'Genus Distribution (Hominidae)' to send features to workbench
			Navigate to the Workbench tab
			For every DNA/RNA annotation:
				Download annotated metagenome fasta file
Run sortFastas.py <fasta_dir> <len cut-off>
	#the fasta_dir is the directory containing your fasta files from the mgrast step
	#the <len cut-off> I ran and used was 100, which means if a sequence is less than 100 nucleotides long, its considered small
	#this script will produce a summary file which contains some data on the average sequence lengths so you can judge if your 
	# cutoff is appropriate
Run blastn.sh <directory_containing_sortedfna_files> <gorilla_db_name> <E-value>
Run findFastas.py <directory_containing_blast_files> <directory_containing_sortedfna_files>
	#this script with find the fasta files that matched something in blast
Run blastn.sh <directory_containing_found_fasta_files> nt <E-value>
	#I used the same E-value as in the first use of blastn.sh
Navigate to the new nt_blast directory.
